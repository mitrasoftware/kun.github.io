  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Insert Date]</p>

  <p>Thank you for using <strong>Brokerless</strong> ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our Android application. Brokerless is a platform that connects property owners with buyers or tenants for renting, leasing, or selling land, homes, and PG accommodations—directly, without middlemen or agents.</p>

  <h2>1. Overview of the App’s Functionality</h2>
  <p>Brokerless allows property owners to list their properties, and lets buyers or tenants communicate directly with them. We do not act as intermediaries. Users voluntarily provide listing details, and we do not collect personal information beyond what is shared publicly for listing purposes.</p>

  <h2>2. Permissions We Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>INTERNET:</strong> Enables communication between the app and our server for listings and updates.</li>
    <li><strong>READ_PHONE_STATE:</strong> Used for limited device integrity checks. We do not access call data.</li>
    <li><strong>CAMERA:</strong> Allows users to capture property photos directly for their listings.</li>
    <li><strong>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE / WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:</strong> Allows uploading of photos from the user’s gallery, only those selected by the user.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>We do not collect or store:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Passwords or sensitive personal details</li>
    <li>GPS/location data (unless entered manually by the user)</li>
    <li>Call logs, contacts, or messages</li>
    <li>Biometrics or payment information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data You May Provide</h2>
  <p>Users may voluntarily provide the following information for public listing purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Name or contact number (optional)</li>
    <li>Property details like location, size, rent/sale price, images, and description</li>
    <li>Any notes or instructions added by the property owner</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>All data submitted by users is used strictly for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To display property listings to other users</li>
    <li>To enable direct communication between property owners and seekers</li>
    <li>To improve app functionality, stability, and user experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not share your personal data with advertisers or third parties. Data is disclosed only when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Required by law or legal process</li>
    <li>Necessary to protect the rights and safety of Brokerless, its users, or others</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Data such as property listings is stored until the user chooses to delete it or requests removal. Users can manage or delete their own listings at any time through the app.</p>

  <h2>8. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>We implement standard security protocols to protect user-submitted data, including encrypted transmission and access controls. However, no system is completely secure, so users are encouraged to share only non-sensitive public information.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Brokerless is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If we discover such data has been submitted, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>10. User Rights & Control</h2>
  <p>Users have full control over the data they submit and can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Edit or remove their listings</li>
    <li>Revoke app permissions through device settings</li>
    <li>Contact us for data removal or concerns</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>Brokerless may include links to external apps or services (e.g., messaging apps, maps). We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those services.</p>

  <h2>12. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes will be updated in the app or our official website. Your continued use of the app implies consent to the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
